# dlew's dotfiles!
welcome to my dotfiles, this is a WIP of getting all of my dotfiles into this repo!

## Setup
to setup, clone this repo and store into `~/.dotfiles` (or wherever you'd like, but that's where i store mine!)
you will have to manually run `ln -s <dotfile config file> ~/.<config>` on each file in every folder... curently ;)
